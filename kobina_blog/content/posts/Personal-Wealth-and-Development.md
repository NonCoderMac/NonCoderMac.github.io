Everybody wants money! At least, everyone I know. Interestingly, if you are to ask them what they have 
done today to get them the money they want, it'll be difficult for them to say, but I digress. From my 
own experience, I have found that understanding the motivations for your desires really helps you 
strategize to get your desires. So that's the first thing to find out for yourself - why do you want 
to be wealthy? If you can't be honest with yourself, then that's sad.

The rational for acquiring wealth would also determine the dos and don'ts of the process. For example, 
I personally want wealth because it affords me freedom - the freedom to choose and the freedom to be, 
and because my values are tied to everything I do, it is important that I do what is legal and justifiable 
according to my beliefs to acquire this wealth. This alone eliminates a number of actions I can take. Also, 
it informs me to always have some back-up funds for my "freedom". 

If you're like me, you weren't given "a pot of gold" when you reached a certain age so you had to work for 
everything. This is where a dedication to your personal development comes to play. Why? Because you really 
can't survive on your salary alone. This is even more pronounced when you aren't working. The skills and 
information you acquire along your personal development path are, in most cases, the supporting structures 
you need to create the wealth you want.

So what is personal wealth? Wealth, by one dictionary, is an abundance of valuable material possessions or 
resources. Since our needs always increase, abundance should be  'equally increasing', in the worst case. 
Think about that. There's a strategy there but that's for another day. So creating personal wealth is simply 
doing something by yourself to create an abundance of valuable resources. Abundance is simply 'having more 
than you need and want'.

What of personal development? To develop is to acquire or become gradually. This means that a target should 
be in sight. If not, what are you trying to become or acquire? This is where self-evaluation and self-vision 
comes to play - identifying your mission and vision especially in all areas that are important to you. Then, 
you can work out activities to help you develop as you would want. Notice that the definition says 'gradually' 
so take it easy on yourself. 

Since personal development is tied to personal wealth, then clearly, time can be a friend or foe so I conclude 
with the modified words of Marcus Aurelius - waste no more time arguing what a man of wealth should be, be one 
NOW and the first step is to develop yourself!
