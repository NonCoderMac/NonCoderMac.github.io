### Kobina Bentum here - an engineer, designer, digital maker and problem-solver

My curiousity has helped me pick up quite a number of skills. Even though I do not really consider myself an 
expert in any one thing, I do admit that I have a lot of intermediate-level skills, that can easily make you 
believe otherwise.

My approach is simple - find a goal or objective and try to learn all the skills you need for that particular objective 
to come alive. To be fair, I genuinely **love knowledge** so I guess that makes it easy for me to some extent. I 
also do not shy away from problems. On the contrary, I embrace them, but it's always good to know when to quit!
