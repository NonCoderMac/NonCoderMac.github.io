      <p>Everybody wants money! At least, everyone I know. Interestingly, if you are to ask them what they have
done today to get them the money they want, it&rsquo;ll be difficult for them to say, but I digress. From my
own experience, I have found that understanding the motivations for your desires really helps you
strategize to get your desires. So that&rsquo;s the first thing to find out for yourself - why do you want
to be wealthy? If you can&rsquo;t be honest with yourself, then that&rsquo;s sad.</p>
<p>The rational for acquiring wealth would also determine the dos and don&rsquo;ts of the process. For example,
I personally want wealth because it affords me freedom - the freedom to choose and the freedom to be,
and because my values are tied to everything I do, it is important that I do what is legal and justifiable
according to my beliefs to acquire this wealth. This alone eliminates a number of actions I can take. Also,
it informs me to always have some back-up funds for my &ldquo;freedom&rdquo;.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re like me, you weren&rsquo;t given &ldquo;a pot of gold&rdquo; when you reached a certain age so you had to work for
everything. This is where a dedication to your personal development comes to play. Why? Because you really
can&rsquo;t survive on your salary alone. This is even more pronounced when you aren&rsquo;t working. The skills and
information you acquire along your personal development path are, in most cases, the supporting structures
you need to create the wealth you want.</p>
<p>So what is personal wealth? Wealth, by one dictionary, is an abundance of valuable material possessions or
resources. Since our needs always increase, abundance should be  &lsquo;equally increasing&rsquo;, in the worst case.
Think about that. There&rsquo;s a strategy there but that&rsquo;s for another day. So creating personal wealth is simply
doing something by yourself to create an abundance of valuable resources. Abundance is simply &lsquo;having more
than you need and want&rsquo;.</p>
<p>What of personal development? To develop is to acquire or become gradually. This means that a target should
be in sight. If not, what are you trying to become or acquire? This is where self-evaluation and self-vision
comes to play - identifying your mission and vision especially in all areas that are important to you. Then,
you can work out activities to help you develop as you would want. Notice that the definition says &lsquo;gradually&rsquo;
so take it easy on yourself.</p>
<p>Since personal development is tied to personal wealth, then clearly, time can be a friend or foe so I conclude
with the modified words of Marcus Aurelius - waste no more time arguing what a man of wealth should be, be one
NOW and the first step is to develop yourself!</p>
