      <p>I once spoke to a colleague about managing money and he seemed surprised about the results I was
getting from my money-management practices. He complained about how he found it difficult to manage
his money because the money often just vanished.</p>
<p>That was intriguing for me. How could your money just vanish? At least, you should know what you did
with your funds. So I challenged him to track his expenditure. I recommended an app that I found very
useful for me.</p>
<p>The steps were simple:
<em>First, estimate your monthly expenses.</em> This is just so you have some sort of baseline to work with.
Call that baseline a budget. I usually advice that on your first attempt, you should round-up your figures
so you don&rsquo;t stress yourself from underestimation.</p>
<p><em>Secondly, put the remaining money (after deducting your budget) into a safe investment like T-bills.</em>
Treasury bills are perfect for this exercise because you can always go for your money without any impact
to your principal. Often times, people tend to spend just because they have. Investing in T-bills eliminates
that tendency.</p>
<p><em>Thirdly, consciously track all expenses.</em> Now, I will be frank with you. This isn&rsquo;t as easy as it sounds.
You WILL forget to input your expenses a number of times but remember that the target is improvement not
perfection, so keep at it. After a while, it&rsquo;ll become second-nature to you.</p>
<p><em>Finally, consciously try to live below your budget.</em> The baseline or budget was created based on your current
living standards. This ideally means that there was hardly any inconvenience factored into it. Now, try to save
money from your budget. Take the &ldquo;trotro&rdquo; instead of the uber or dropping. Spend on cheaper breakfast, say, ₵1
bread with ₵1.5 koko, instead of say, ₵5 waakye. Have an intentional weekly target for recurring costs like call
credits or data and try to manage them well. Plan your movements so that you don&rsquo;t spend more than required. You
can even move some activities to other days so you can maximise your movements. All these are just suggestions
that worked for me. I am sure you can come up with even better ones. At the core of all this, the strategy is the
same - try to make savings from your budget.</p>
<p>If this works out for you, you would not only have some extra funds from the T-bills (although relatively low), you
would also have saved a lot of money and developed good spending habits in the process.</p>
<p>If this doesn&rsquo;t work out initially, try again. Only this time, slightly increase your spending money but not to the
point of utter comfort. Remember, the goal is to suffer now, to gain later - that&rsquo;s how savings work. Something has
got to give. Always spend the money you have left after saving, not the other way round (saving the money you have
left after spending).</p>
<p>I am curious to know how this works for you. Please share your thoughts and any other cuts you made to help you save
from your budget.</p>
