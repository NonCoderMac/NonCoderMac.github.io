      <p>Last week, we spoke about having a budget and trying to live well below that budget. One major benefit of this is that we learn to exercise
restraint when it comes to to our expenses. However, there was a lot of flexibility with that tip. This week, we want to refine this concept
a bit more. Let&rsquo;s dive in folks!</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say a great misfortune came upon you and you were fired from your current work. Now, the only job you can get is paying half the amount
you were making and there is no way to get a better paying job! What would you do? Nothing, except to manage it till something better comes
along. Often times, we forget that our circumstances are not permanent and that anything can happen to us. As such, we fail to plan for what
could happen. In today&rsquo;s piece, I want to talk about savings.</p>
<p>When it comes to savings, I try to do two things - to save about 50% of my salary and to plan prior to any purchase. These ideas have really
helped me in this financial journey.</p>
<p>Like I mentioned earlier, when all you have left is half of your salary, you would naturally make adjustments to suit it and that&rsquo;s what I
try to do every month. This is very very difficult especially with all the responsibilities I have and I must admit that sometimes, I save
less that this amount. However, I have a standing order that helps me save at least 25% automatically every month but we&rsquo;ll talk more about
standing orders later. If your budget takes more than half of your income, try to streamline it some more until you can live on less than
half of your income. This may involve spending less on data or cooking more for yourself or even buying a bicycle so you can cut down on
transportation costs (I actually did this while working in Takoradi). The objective is to be more intentional about the percentage you want
to save and I highly recommend trying to live on about half of your steady income. However, I understand that we may consider what we are
even making to be inadequate. Alright, fair enough but what are your options? To try to manage what you have or to finish everything off
because it isn&rsquo;t sufficient for you. I pray you lean towards the former. But, in this case you may want to reduce the percentage you save.
For me, I try not to go below 25% every month even in the worst cases (except when I am investing in an asset). Why? Because the truth is that
it takes money to make more money so if you don&rsquo;t have any money in the first place, you really can&rsquo;t make more out of it.</p>
<p>Secondly, I hardly ever buy something without taking some time to review prices of similar brands or even the price of the same product,
from other shops. I try to get about 3 different prices before I make the purchase. This helps me get value for whatever I purchase usually
at the expense of calling credit but I think it is worth it. Also, I don&rsquo;t buy anything in the first month that I want the thing unless there
is a golden opportunity there. This is because I have realised that after a while, the desire to buy certain things fade away so this helps me
determine if I really want the item. Obviously, these concepts won&rsquo;t apply to everything. I have a threshold amount that I use to determine when
i can apply these tips. Additionally, I prefer to save gradually to buy something than to buy it at a go but this applies mostly to tech stuff.
The theme of this second tip is to plan before you buy through either cost comparisons, stalling the purchase or even through gradual savings for
the item. Believe it or not, this could actually help you save some money in the long term.</p>
<p>I hope you find this week&rsquo;s tip useful. Let me know what you think.</p>
