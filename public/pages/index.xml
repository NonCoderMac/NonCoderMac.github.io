      <description>Kobina Bentum here - an engineer, designer, digital maker and problem-solver My curiousity has helped me pick up quite a number of skills. Even though I do not really consider myself an expert in any one thing, I do admit that I have a lot of intermediate-level skills, that can easily make you believe otherwise.
My approach is simple - find a goal or objective and try to learn all the skills you need for that particular objective to come alive.</description>
